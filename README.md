## Availability of Air Traffic Control Tower in the US

 Above is a snippet of the whole entire map locating where all the airports are, and if within each airport will contain an air traffic control tower. The map is simple, indicating green for available air traffic control tower and black for no available air traffic control tower. Even so, there are different colors along with scale/ranges indicating the amount of airports within each state. I tried to keep it a cool yellow/blueish color for easy comparison without having colors being too similar to each other. I used data from data.gov, and data from Mike Bostock of D3. All of this was possible helping create outlines for states, and providing geographic locations for each airport around the US. The basemap is provided by CartoDB for a clean and sleek white look to make the main data pop out as it serves the main purpose of this map which was to show number of airports within each state, and the availability of air traffic control tower within those airport. From the map, ideas can be made that airports near the coast of the US tend to have available air traffic control tower, hence indicating more greens around the coast, and more blacks within the middle of the US. However, as for Alaska, not many would travel there much therefore indicating a lot of blacks for no availability of air traffic control tower because these towers are not necessary.
